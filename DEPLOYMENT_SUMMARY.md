## 🔧 Environment Variables for Railway

**Add these in Railway UI:**

### 5 Required Variables:

```env
# 1. Database Connection
DATABASE_URL=${MYSQL_URL}

# 2. Environment Mode
NODE_ENV=production

# 3. Admin Password (CHANGE THIS!)
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!

# 4. Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=https://${RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}

# 5. React API URL
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://${RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}/api
```

**⚠️ Important:** 
- Use `${MYSQL_URL}` - Railway provides this from MySQL service
- Use `${RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}` - Railway provides your domain
- Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to something secure!

## 📊 How It Works

### Architecture:
```
User Browser
     ↓
Railway Domain (HTTPS)
     ↓
Node.js Server (Express)
     ↓
├── Static Files (React build)
├── API Endpoints (/api/*)
└── MySQL Database
```

### Request Flow:
1. User visits `https://your-app.railway.app`
2. Server serves React app (static HTML/JS)
3. React makes API calls to `/api/contestants` or `/api/votes`
4. Server queries MySQL database
5. Returns JSON response
6. React updates UI

### Vote Tracking:
1. User visits Vote page
2. React generates device fingerprint
3. Sends fingerprint with vote to API
4. Server checks database for existing vote
5. Allows vote or one change, then locks
6. Stores in MySQL with device_id

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Solution:** 
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is set to `${MYSQL_URL}`
- Verify MySQL service is running in Railway
- Wait a few minutes after adding MySQL

### Issue: "Admin password doesn't work"
**Solution:**
- Check `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in Railway variables
- Verify no extra spaces in the value
- Default is `SpookyAdmin2024!`

### Issue: CORS errors in browser console
**Solution:**
- Update `FRONTEND_URL` to match your Railway domain
- Redeploy after changing variables
- Check server logs for CORS errors

### Issue: Vote not persisting
**Solution:**
- Verify database tables were created (run setup script)
- Check browser console for API errors
- Test with curl: `curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/votes`
